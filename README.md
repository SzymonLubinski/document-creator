# document-creator
document-creator is a program writted in Python that takes data from a csv file, writes a document and saves it as a pdf. In the documents we see text consistent with the data and two charts.

# Program capabilities
After starting the program, we can choose in a console the region and the size of the apartments. Document Creator will do the rest.

# Libraries
In the program I used libraries such as:
-	Pandas
-	Numpy
-	Matplotlib
-	Seaborn
-	Docx and docx2pdf 
# Data source
I downloaded the data from the local data bank of GUS. Link to the website: https://bdl.stat.gov.pl/bdl/start.
